                        <p>Hello, I am Tatiana Bertazoli and I am a Junior Software Developer.
                            I was born and raised in Brazil where I got a degree in Chemistry. I moved to Canada in 2010 and spent 8 years there whith
                            my family. In 2018 we decided to move to Texas where I decided to pursue a new career in web development.
                            In 2022 I started a bootcamp at Rice University and so far I have been working on some small personal projects to improve my knowledge
                            until I am able to start working in this field.

                            My projects were written using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, APIs, SQL, NoSQL, Express.js, React.
